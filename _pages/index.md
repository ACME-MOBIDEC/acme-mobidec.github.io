The transition to a low-carbon mobility system cannot focus on people alone: it must consider goods as well.
Out of the 331 billion ton-kilometers of merchandise transported yearly in France, 89% travel by road and only 11% by rail or waterways ([source](https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/chiffres-cles-des-transports-edition-2025-0)).
To improve carbon efficiency in the short run, we have two levers at our disposal: making better use of each individual truck, and replacing some of these trucks with less carbon-heavy alternatives.
In both cases, a key ingredient is mutualization, whereby several industrial actors work together to pool their resources and achieve economies of scale.

Our project ACME (_Approvisionnement Collaboratif Multimodal Ã‰cologique_) seeks to explore the environmental, economic and organizational benefits of mutualization in the supply chain.
It benefits from public funding through [Agence Nationale de la Recherche](https://anr.fr/en) as part of [France 2030](https://anr.fr/en/france-2030/france-2030/) (reference "ANR-24-PEMO-0001"), alongside other projects of the [PEPR MOBIDEC](https://pepr-mobidec.fr/).
